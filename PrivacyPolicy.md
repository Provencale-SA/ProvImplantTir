**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the ProvImplantTir app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Provencale SA (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

**What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?**

The Application does not obtain any information when you download and use it. Registration is not required to use the Application.

**Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?**

This Application registers the location of your mobile device only when the button "Enregister le trou" is used. This data is only stored as a file (.geojson) on your device, with no hidden method to share it. You can share the file using "Partager" and it will only be sent to the destination of your choosing (we do not collect anything).

**Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?**

Since the Application does not collect any information, no data is shared with third parties.

**What are my opt-out rights?**

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

**Children**

The Application is not used to solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not collect personally identifiable information from children.

**Security**

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. However, since the Application does not collect any information, there is no risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.

**Changes**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
