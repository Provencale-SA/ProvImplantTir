# ProvImplantTir
Small internal application Android/java registering (on button press) GPS/GNSS position in a json file. 

The json file will be stored at \Internal storage memory\Android\data\com.provencale.provimplanttir\files\. So there is no need for internet access.
There is a mecanism to avoid registering a position before the accuracy is seemed acceptable.
